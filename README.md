### Statistical Analysis Projects with R
<a id="statistical-analysis-projects-with-r"></a>

#### 🔹 **A. Statistical Analysis & Advanced Statistics using R**  
**Duration:** Sep 2024 - Dec 2025  

- **Dataset:** [Concrete Strength Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchikakumbhar/concrete-strength-prediction)  
- **R Analysis Repository:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mananabbasi/Applied_Statistics_-_Data_Visualisation_)  

**Objective:**  
To perform statistical analysis on the dataset, uncover insights, and support data-driven decision-making by understanding relationships between variables.  

---

## **Key Visualizations**  

## **Process**  
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers, ensuring data consistency.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed distributions and relationships using visualizations.  
3. **Hypothesis Testing:**  
   - Conducted t-tests and chi-square tests to validate assumptions.  
4. **Regression Analysis:**  
   - Built linear regression models and evaluated performance.  
5. **ANOVA:**  
   - Compared means across groups to identify significant differences.  
6. **Visualization:**  
   - Created visualizations using **ggplot2** for clear insights.  


## **Tools Used**  
- **R** (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, caret, stats, etc)

### 🔹 **B.Time Series Forecasting Models in R  
**Duration:** Nov 2024 - Dec 2024  

## **Dataset**  
[Vital Statistics in the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/vitalstatisticspopulationandhealthreferencetables)  

## **Code**  
[Vital Statistics in the UK - Time Series Modelling](https://github.com/mananabbasi/Time-Series-Modelling/blob/main/Birth_time_series.R)  

## **Objective**  
To develop accurate time series forecasting models for predicting future trends, enabling stakeholders to optimize business strategies.  

## **Process**  
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Collected and cleaned historical time series data.  
   - Ensured stationarity using transformations (e.g., differencing).  
2. **Model Selection:**  
   - Evaluated **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **ETS** models for accuracy.  
3. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Used **RMSE** and **MAE** to measure model performance.  
   - Performed cross-validation to ensure robustness.  
4. **Visualization:**  
   - Created visualizations to compare predicted vs actual values.  

## **Tools Used**  
- **R**

## **Key Visualizations**
